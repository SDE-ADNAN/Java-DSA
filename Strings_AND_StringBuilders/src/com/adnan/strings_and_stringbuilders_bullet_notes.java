    1. strings are just like arrays and we can iterate over them like arrays with help of indexing

    2. strings are immutable in java for some of security reasons.
       as if u declare a
       var a ="adnan"
       and then ur accessing it by a different var b
       and if somehow this var a got changed then the value reffered by the var b will also get changed
       (if both var a and b are pointing towards the same string in the heap memory )
       these variables are stored in the stack memory but the string object is stored in the heap memory.
