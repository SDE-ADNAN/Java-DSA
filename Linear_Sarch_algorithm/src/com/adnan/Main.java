//        arr = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
//        Q: Find whether 4 exists in the arr array??
//        Ans: firstly iterate over the given array and search for the value on each index
//             after that if the value is found then return the index of that value or return -1;;
//         =================================================================================

//        ABOUT : Time Complexity
/*       1. time complexity is calculated by the searching time taken by our algorithm to search any item
//          given in a dataset..
//       2. in the best case we will get our item at the first index which will be completed in minimum time
//          in  this type of case the length of the array does not matters as we are getting our
//          result/target value at the first index/place
//          so the  big 'O' notation for this case will be O(1)
//       3. in the worst case where we iterated through the whole array of thousands items or millions of items
//          but still failed to find the target , here the time is directly proportional to the length of the array
//          for this we get a linear graph where time increases with the increase in size of the array..
