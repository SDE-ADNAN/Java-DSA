Hard

Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.

Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
Output: 9
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,4,4], m = 3
Output: 4


Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
0 <= nums[i] <= 106
1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)

// this question is very complicated as we are not able to differentiate among the options of whether to use binary search
// or not to use binary search in this question this must be done multiple times to be remembered .
