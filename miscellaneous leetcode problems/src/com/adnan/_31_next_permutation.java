    Approach
We can follow the below steps -

Scan the array from right to left until an element is found which is smaller than the index at its right. Mark the index of such element as index.
Again scan the array from right to left until an element is found which is greater than the element found in the above step. Mark the index of such elements as j.
Swap the two elements at indices index and j.
Now, reverse the array from index index until the end of the array.
Letâ€™s understand this with an example -

nums = [4,5,3,2,1]

Step 1: scan from right to left and stop at 4 because it less than 5. Here, index = 0
Step 2: Again scan from right to left and stop at 5 because it is greater than 4. Here, j = 1
Step 3: Swap the elements at index and j. The array will become [5,4,3,2,1].
Step 4: Reverse the array after index. The array will become [5,1,2,3,4]
Time Complexity
We are iterating the array two times. In the worst case, the time complexity will be O(2n) which is equivalent to O(n).

Space Complexity
We are not using any data structure for intermediate computations. Hence, the space complexity will be O(1).
